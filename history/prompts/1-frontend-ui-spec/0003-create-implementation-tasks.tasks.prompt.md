Successfully created comprehensive implementation tasks for the premium Todo application frontend UI with proper organization by user story and clear execution order.

## Outcome Impact
Established detailed task breakdown for frontend implementation with 60 specific tasks organized by user story priority and dependencies.

## Tests Summary
No automated tests were run as this was a task planning exercise.

## Files Summary
Created tasks.md with complete task breakdown organized by implementation phases and user stories.

## Next Prompts
Begin implementation following the task list in priority order.

## Reflection Note
The tasks are well-organized by user story priority with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Failure Modes Observed
